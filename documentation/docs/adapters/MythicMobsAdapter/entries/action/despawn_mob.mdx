# Despawn Mob Action

The `Despawn Mob Action` action removes MythicMobs mobs from the world.

## How could this be used?

This action could be used in stories or quests in various ways. For instance, if a player fails a quest to kill 10 zombies, then the zombies could be despawned to signal that the quest is no longer active. One could even use this action for a quest to kill a certain amount of mobs within a time limit!
