# In Region Fact

A [fact](/docs/facts) that checks if the player is in a specific region. The value will be `0` if the player is not in the region, and `1` if the player is in the region.

<ReadonlyFactInfo />

## How could this be used?

This fact could be used to make a quest only available in a specific region, or could even be used as a condition for player abilities that only work in specific areas!

## Fields

<FactsField />

<EntryField name="Region" required>
    The name of the region which the player must be in. (Region Name, Not DisplayName)
</EntryField>
